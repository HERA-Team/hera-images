HERA Docker Image Specifications
================================

This repository has scripts and documentation for running the [HERA] software
stack inside a set of [Docker] containers. This allows you to test all of them
in a single machine in a way that is both reproducible and realistic.

[Docker]: https://www.docker.com/
[HERA]: http://reionization.org/

For a demonstration of how to use these images to test the HERA software, see
[DEMO](DEMO.md).

For a list of the various images that are defined and how they expect to
interface with one another, see [IMAGES](IMAGES.md).

To learn how to build new images on your machine, see [BUILDING](BUILDING.md).
Prebuilt images are available at [pkgw’s account on Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/pkgw/).
